Hi, I’m Valensi Grevazi and I specialized in Mathematics. I’m passionate about what I do, and I love to help people. Nothing is more fulfilling than being part of a team with similar interests, and an organization that values its people.

I am passionate about Mathematical Modelling and communities. I just enjoy working on new ideas. Also work as smart as possible. I love designing Mathematical Model with the aim of solving problems in the society. I am always ready to learn new things and help people, organisations and companies however due to large volume of requests, i give attention to paid requests.

I studied Bachelor of science with education in Mathematics and Geography at Sokoine University(SUA),Tanzania from 2016 to 2019. Currently am persuing Master's in Mathematical Sciences at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences,Rwanda.

Being 100% perfect in the sight of everyman is hard, but making up high quality designs is fun. I made this site so that I can balance the two.

Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.

I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort, I love hip-hop and R&B music, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure.
